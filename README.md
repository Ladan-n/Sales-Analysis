# Sales-Analysis
## Summary
A US national retail store is collecting hundreds of data from all sales intractions around the country everyday. Extracting valuable insights from this huge data has the potential to help the sales managers in their decision making process and finding the areas where they can work on improving sale and maximizing profit. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the power of data visulization and data analysis to extract such valuable insights.

## Visulization
The overall sales is depicted as a [pie chart](https://github.com/Ladan-n/Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Bargraph_of_Profit_for_States.png). It shows that 80.7% of the sales is profitable, 18.6% is loss-making, and 0.7% is no-profit, respectively.
A visulization of the data using Tableau is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ladan.naimi/viz/Salesvis_16382520368160/Dashboard1#3).
